How much time does finding 50000 in the Binary Search Tree consume compared to the Heap?
The BST find takes 0.016 seceonds and Heap takes 0.000007.

How much time does the average deletion consume in a Binary Search Tree compared to the Heap?
The BST deletion takes 0.000008 seconds and the Heap takes 0.000004.

When would you use a Binary Search Tree and why?
When Search for arbitrary elements is important because the worse case time of O(log(n)) is better than Heap.


When would you use an Heap and why?
You would use an Heap when looking for the minimum value because the worse case time is O(n), which is better than BST.
