How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

For Line, there are the "join" and "leave" methods. For Pixel and Screen, developers can set the pixel color, coordinate, and screen size respectively.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

Line allows for a search by "person" ie name. Screen's "at" allows for a developer to search for a color at a particular coordinate.

What other real-world data can each structure represent?

Any line of people, doesn't have to be amusement park ride. Pixel could be used to define anything needing color and a starting coordinate.
